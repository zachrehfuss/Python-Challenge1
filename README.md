PyBank
In the PyBank folder my code is titled PyBank_starter.
There is also a resources folder that contains the a csv with the data and an analysis folder where the text document will print. 

In the PyBank code I utilized code from the Xpert Learning Assistant as well as
my friend taught me about multi line F string formatting which I used to generate the output variable
and write the results in the text file. He also taught me about +=1 to increment the total months. 
The Analysis Folder is empty as the text files print to those folders once the program has been run

PyPoll
In the PyBank folder my code is titled PyPoll_starter.
There is also a resources folder that contains the a csv with the data and an analysis folder where the text document will print. 

In the PyBank code I used code that Xpert Learning assistant that helped answer some of my questions 
and my friend taught me about the New Line Character to help with my string formatting when I printed the output to the text file and the terminal. 
The Analysis Folder is empty as the text files print to those folders once the program has been run
